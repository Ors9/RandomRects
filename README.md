# JavaFX Grid-Based Randomization

## Description
This project implements a **JavaFX-based grid simulation** where **10% of the grid cells are randomly filled with rectangles** when the user clicks a button. The visualization is rendered using a `Canvas` component within a JavaFX application.

## Features
- **Canvas-Based Rendering**: The grid is displayed using JavaFX's `Canvas`.
- **Randomized Updates**: Each button press fills 10% of the grid cells at random.
- **Grid Structure**: The grid consists of evenly spaced columns with a fixed spacing of 10 pixels.
- **Efficient Rendering**: Uses the `fillRect` method from `GraphicsContext` to update the grid efficiently.

## Usage
1. **Run the JavaFX Application**: Launch the program to display the grid.
2. **Click the Button**: Every click will randomly fill 10% of the grid with black rectangles.
3. **Observe Dynamic Updates**: The display updates each time a new randomization is triggered.

This project is a structured demonstration of JavaFX **graphics handling, randomization logic, and user interaction with GUI elements**.
